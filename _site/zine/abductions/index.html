Their crimes? Simply expressing the opinion that the U.S. should not be giving billions of dollars to Israel to commit genocide in Palestine. These arrests are damning and blatant attacks on the right to free speech that our country claims to value so much. By making an example out of these students, the state hopes to instill fear and discourage others from taking a stand in the fight for liberation. It’s rightfully terrifying, but also just the latest in our nation’s long history of violating people’s rights to silence dissent.">

By the time you read this zine, who is being targeted and the reason we’re given for it may be different, but the fact will remain: the state is ruining people’s lives in order to silence their voices and frighten the rest of us into compliance. They want us to feel alone, to focus only on our own survival and comfort, but we’re all sliding down the slippery slope of authoritarianism together. Only through solidarity—recognizing and acting upon our interconnectedness—do we have a chance to resist its pull.
