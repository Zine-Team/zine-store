Tin, tungsten, tantalum, gold, and cobalt: many of the metals vital to the productionof green technology are extracted primarilyin the Democratic Republic of Congo. To meet the Global North’s fervent demand for these minerals, sprawling mines have been built across the DRC. Within them, human rights abuses and child labor abound. The mines generate toxic dust that poisons the air and water, and millions of people have been killed or displaced by their expansion. An ongoing history of racism and colonialism has created the conditions for the world to ignore the violence the Global North enacts upon the Congo and across the Global South. A “better future” promised by green capitalism will never be just as long as this exploitation is allowed to continue.">

When one era of colonization ends, it leaves instability in its wake, creating the opportunity for another force to seize upon the DRC’s bountiful resources. (And the one time the country had the chance to democratically elect a leader, the C.I.A. promptly had him assassinated.)">
