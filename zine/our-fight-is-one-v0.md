    altText: "How are these stories connected? These are all stories of DISPLACEMENT: people who have been forced to leave their homes to survive. But WHY have all these people been forced out of their homes? Who benefits from them leaving? How are ALL OF US connected to these stories?"

    altText: "We will delve deeper into these questions throughout this series, but essentially these stories are the consequences of Racial Capitalism (a system that uses racism to maintain profit for the wealthy & keeps the exploited majority divided) and U.S. Imperialism (the global arm of racial capitalism dominating other countries economically & militarily to profit off their people, labor, land, and resources). From Chicago to Latin America to Palestine – these systems have left a wake of DISINVESTMENT, DEHUMANIZATION, DESTABILIZATION, & DESTRUCTION."

    altText: "This racist, profit-driven, violent system is responsible for the lack of affordable quality housing, good jobs, & community resources that lead to homelessness. This system is behind U.S. military invasions & economic stragulation in Mexico, Cuba, Guatemala, Honduras, Haiti, Nicaragua, Venezuela, & other Latin American countries that migrants are fleeing. This system is behind the ethnic cleansing & genocide of Palestinians. This system is behind every aspect of wealth accumulation to the few, at the cost & exploitation of the global majority."

    altText: "U.S. Racial Capitalism is in Crisis. The U.S. empire is in decline. More & more people in the U.S. don't believe in the system as they struggle to survive. After all, this system has plundered our wages, our health, our education, our communities, our planet. In the past 20 years, people have been rising up for racial, gender, sexual, economic, health, & climate justice. The forces against us organized & connected. They want to turn us against each other. They use violent tactics to repress & silence us. Their fear of the people is why they don't want educators to teach the truth. By connecting our struggles, we can build our power. OUR FIGHT IS ONE."
